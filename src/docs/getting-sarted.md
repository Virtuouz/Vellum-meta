Getting started with Vellum is a straightforward process, but your first steps will depend on how you plan to work with your content.

Please choose the path that best describes your role:

## Visual Editors
For Visual Editors (Using CloudCannon)
If you prefer a visual, click-based interface and will be writing and managing content through the CloudCannon CMS, this is the path for you. You'll learn how to create pages, add components, and configure your site without touching a line of code.

➡️ Continue to the [Visual Editing Guide](src/docs/visual-guide/getting-sarted.md)

## Developers
For Developers (Working Locally)
If you're comfortable with code and want to run the project on your own machine, edit Markdown files directly, and customize the template's structure, this is your path. You'll learn how to set up the local environment, create content with Markdown, and extend Vellum's functionality.
